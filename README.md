## Duration of project

- 2021/07/11 ~ 2021/07/13 (2Ïùº)

## What I learn from this project

- Make basic layout by CSS.
- Split view by react components.
- Also it was a great chance to think about reusability.
- Data rendering by props, and how to use state well!

### Why I quit this project

- Before start, I was thinking that I can take React-Redux knowledge by this project.
- But it was not great example to use redux I think.
- Also, too big project to make really good.
